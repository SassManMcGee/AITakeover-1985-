## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

Main topic: Trust in AI

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world is moving towards a more digital way to buy and sale goods. E-commerce is becoming the largest way for consmers to make purchases and globally e-commerce sales are expected to hit $5.5 trillion in 2022. Around 76% of U.S. adults shop online (CITE). As such people will need avenues to get help on their journeys through the digital landscapes. Chatbots as a cost effective way companies can provide help to customers without needing to have the workforce to back it up. As such the need for a better understanding of how users interact and perceive chatbots is needed.



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present study seeks to understand users perceptions of AI powered chatbots that have different levels of human-likeness in their icons. The study looks to apply the foundational understanding of uncanny valley and look to its relevance in designing avatars for AI chatbots on degree of human-likeness. The present study also wants to understand the effects of having always visiable AI chatbot icons versus only seeing the icon when users activate the chat. The study seeks to understand whether having the icon always visible intensifies levels of affinity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H1: Differences should be observed between the levels of realism of the AI icon and levels in affinity (trust, likeability, perceived intelligence)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H1A: Cartoonish nonhuman should have the highest level of affinity but lowest level of anthropomorphism.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H1B: Realistic humanoid should invoke the lowest levels of affinity.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H2: Differences in affinity levels should be present in visual icons versus non-visual icons.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H2A: Visual realistic humanoid should invoke the lowest levels of affinity.

## Methods

IV: Realism of Icon (cartoonish nonhuman icon, realistic humanoid icon, hyper realistic human icon), Visual Cues (text-based vs visual based)

DV: trust, anthropomorphism, likeability, perceived intelligence

Deception DV: SUS (Usability)

Covariate: Attitudes towards AI

|------------|------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
|            |            | Cartoon-ish Nonhuman   | Realistic Humanoid     | Hyper realistic Human  |

|            | Non-visual | [SUS] Usability, Trust | [SUS] Usability, Trust | [SUS] Usability, Trust |


Operational definitions:

Realism of AI icon will be based within a pictoral form as opposed to including any form of motion. Hyper realistic human would be most optimally closest to a human in appearance while not being a true human picture. Realistic humanoid would act as the control withiin this setting as most e-commerse sites utilize a cartoony realistic humanoid. Cartoon-ish nonhuman will be the cute nonhuman avatar that is closest to toy-like.
