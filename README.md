## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

Main topic: Trust in AI

Real-world: E-commerce is becoming the largest way for consmers to make purchases. Global e-commerce sales are expected to hit $5.5 trillion in 2022. Around 76% of U.S. adults shop online.

Experiment idea: Investigating the clicking behaviors of users based on the degree of humanistic appearance of an AI chatbot Icon image. Chatbot will be utalized as a e-commerse website assistant. The website will purposely utalize poor UI that demand the user to use the assistant. Measurements will be the clicking behaviors of the user as well as the time to use of the agent. Covariates of AI general attitudes will be used to understand individuals with very large differences.

IV: Realism of Icon (cartoonish nonhuman icon, realistic humanoid icon, hyper realistic human icon), AI Type (ChatGPT, Simple/traditional)

DV: Number of clicks on website, number of times clicked on agent, number of times agent closed, time between first opening the website and time first used agent

Subjective DV: Trust, SUS (Usability)

Covariate: Attitudes towards AI

Textbased examples:

Cartoon-ish Nonhuman - I am here to lend a hand--er, paw--if you require assistance!

Realistic humanoid - I'm standing by, ready to help you in any way I can.

hyper-realistic human - Hi there! Do you need any help?
