summary/thoughts: 
This article explores the effect of anthropomorphism in AI assistant technology.  The article found that anthropomorphism increases the positive effect of AI assistant technology. They do not, however, have any explanation as to why this is. One observation of the study was that because human emotions are attributed innately to anthropomorphized AI tech, the “uncanny” effect can easily be achieved and lead to mixed reactions/results. It states that when human likeness reaches a certain level, trust plummets but then when likeness surpasses this level, becoming extremely similar to a human agent, trust increases again. They ascertained this by completing an experiment similar to ours in where different levels of anthropomorphizing the agent were evaluated by a group of college students. They found that anthropomorphizing the agent had positive effects, however the mechanism is not clearly defined yet, as to why. It further proposes that anthropomorphism does not correlate with uncanny response. I think this is interesting however, due to the test group (college students) and country of test (Korea), I believe the results could be significantly different with populations evaluated.

summary/thoughts:
The article explores the differences between snythetic (AI-synythesized faces) and real faces. The study is looking at trustworthiness and correct classification of the faces. For classification, white faces were observed to have the most difficult experience in classification most likely due to the overrepresentation in the the database used. More interestingly, The average rating for real faces is less trustworthy than synthetic faces. Although a small effect, Black faces were rated more trustworthy than South Asian faces, but, otherwise, there was no effect across race. Women were rated as significantly more trustworthy than men.

## Review

Summary of article:
This article provides a brief summary of human-decision making processes, design intended to guide behavior, as well as an introduction to "Dark Patterns". Dark Patterns are design choices and patterns that are intended to guide user interaction on websites and applications in order to benefit companies. These design pattterns are deceptive in nature and some research has indicated that users may not be enitrely aware of their existence. The researchers found through interviews and focus groups that users are somewhat aware of "Dark Patterns". Users found them to be deceptive and annoying, however felt resigned to accept dealing with them due to the fact that the services provided by the website/application was necessary for day-to-day life. The main issue with this paper is the small sample size. The sample is also grabbed from convenience at a University. However, the sentiments expressed by participants are similar to similar research on the subject.
