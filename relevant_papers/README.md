## Review

Li & Sung (2021) summary/thoughts: 
This article explores the effect of anthropomorphism in AI assistant technology.  The article found that anthropomorphism increases the positive effect of AI assistant technology. They do not, however, have any explanation as to why this is. One observation of the study was that because human emotions are attributed innately to anthropomorphized AI tech, the “uncanny” effect can easily be achieved and lead to mixed reactions/results. It states that when human likeness reaches a certain level, trust plummets but then when likeness surpasses this level, becoming extremely similar to a human agent, trust increases again. They ascertained this by completing an experiment similar to ours in where different levels of anthropomorphizing the agent were evaluated by a group of college students. They found that anthropomorphizing the agent had positive effects, however the mechanism is not clearly defined yet, as to why. It further proposes that anthropomorphism does not correlate with uncanny response. I think this is interesting however, due to the test group (college students) and country of test (Korea), I believe the results could be significantly different with populations evaluated.

Nightingale & Farid (2022) summary/thoughts:
The article explores the differences between snythetic (AI-synythesized faces) and real faces. The study is looking at trustworthiness and correct classification of the faces. For classification, white faces were observed to have the most difficult experience in classification most likely due to the overrepresentation in the the database used. More interestingly, The average rating for real faces is less trustworthy than synthetic faces. Although a small effect, Black faces were rated more trustworthy than South Asian faces, but, otherwise, there was no effect across race. Women were rated as significantly more trustworthy than men.

Min et al. (2021) summary/thoughts:
This article investigates the impacts of system factors and the characteristics of it's users in the context of trust of AI chatbots. It begins by providing a brief literature review on prior AI chatbot research, as well as a brief introduction to social presence theory. The researchers investigated the impact of user's perceived personlization (information given to them feels catered to them specifically), perceived media richness (the clarity and amount of information given) as well as past usage experience on the social presence of the AI. In turn the social presence was hypothesized to have a positive impact on user trust. Personlization and perceived media richness were found to have a positive imapct on social presence. Usage expereince was also found to have a positive impact on the perceived social presence. Overall, social presence was found to have a positive impact on user trust.
